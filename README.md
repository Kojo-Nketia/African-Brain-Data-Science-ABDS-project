# African-Brain-Data-Science-ABDS-project
This is a mini project about the comparison of certain brain volumes, which are total brain volume, intracranial volume, gray matter volume and white matter volume, collected from individuals as part of the larger Cam-CAN brain study. I collaborated with Abdulrahmon A. Olagunju on this project
